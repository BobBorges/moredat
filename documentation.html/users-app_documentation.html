<h2>The Users App</h2>




<h3>Rationale</h3>


<p>The users app provides a means for keeping track of individual users and customizing how MoReDaT interacts with individual and groups of users. It relies on Django's default User Authentication with a few additions &mdash; a model for storing additional details from idividual users (research group, self-directed bio, gender, picture), a model for differentiating research groups (group name, short-name, language, second-language, description, slug), an assigned tasks model (user, task, complete), and a model for default assigned tasks per research group (group name, task). The User object is the foreign key for the results of the research tasks that generate database data; the user ID number is included in audio data generated. This means that we have a means for research participants to be authenticated by the site and research participants can be designated to research groups; research tasks can be assigned to them based on their group membership.</p>




<h3>How it works</h3>


<p>The researcher must first define research groups with the ResearchGroups model &mdash; this can be done in the admin panel. Two <i>language</i>' fields are provided ('language' and 'L2') because often in questionnaires, we are interested in how our informants view their sociolinguistic setting, e.g. a minority language and a national language, thus these can be defined here. Once research groups are defined, default tasks can be assigned to those research groups (the DefaultAssignedTasksByGroup model). The MoReDaT example project consent form redirects users, on completion, to the UserDetails form, where they choose the research group to which they belong. On successful completion of the UserDetails form, default tasks will be assigned to that user automatically according to the research group they joined via the <span class="code">get_user_details()</span> view function in <span class="code">users/views.py</span>.</p>

<p>Research groups and default assigned tasks are managed in the admin panel. By default The AssignedTasks model is handled by by <span class="code">register()</span> (give consent and user details) and <span class="code">get_user_details()</span> (all the rest) in <span class="code">users/views.py</span>. It's possible to manually assign tasks to users in the admin panel, but by design, it shouldn't be necessary. Tasks (in the main app) do need to be defined manually.</p>




<h2>Components</h2>


<h3>Models</h3>	

	<h4>ResearchGroups</h4>

	<p>ResearchGroups are managed via the admin panel. Fields can be viewed and populated there.</p>


	<h4>UserDetails</h4>

	<p>The UserDetails model stores basic info about the user:
		<ul>
			<li>the research group to which the user belongs</li>
			<li>Date of birth</li>
			<li>the user's gender</li>
			<li>a user autobiography</li>
			<li>a user profile pic</li>
		</ul>
	UserDetails fields are populated by the UserDetailsForm(), the Autobiography() form, and the UpdatePicture() form.
	</p>


	<h4>AssignedTasks</h4>

	<p>By default, AssigendTasks do not need to be managed manually, though they can be assigned via the admin panel.</p>


	<h4>DefaultAssignedTasksByGroup</h4>

	<p>The DefaultAssignedTasksByGroup is managed via the admin panel. Tasks (<span class="code">main/models.py</span>) and ResearchGroups need to be defined before they can be linked in this model.</p>


<h3>Views</h3>

	<h4>register()</h4>

	<p>The register function sends the RegisterUser() form to the register.html template. Upon successful submission of the form, a new user is created and assigned tasks &ndash; consent and get-user-details</p>


	<h4>get_user_details()</h4>

	<p>This function calls the UserDetails form and passes it to the user-details template. On successfult submission of the form the form fields are added to the user's UserDetails Model instance.</p>


	<h4>profile()</h4>

	<p>This function displays the profile.html template. The user profile displays info about the user, UserDetails and active links to unfinished assigned tasks. The profile view also contains the Autobiography form and UpdatePicture form where users can provide a self-directed description and picture of themselves. Both forms populate the UserDetails model.</p>


<h3>Forms</h3>

	<h4>RegisterUser()</h4>

	<h4>UserDetailsForm()</h4>

	<h4>Autobiography()</h4>

	<h4>UpdatePicture()</h4>


<h3>custom_context_processor.py</h3>

<p>This function (also named <span class="code">get_user_details()</span>, unfortunately &mdash; not to be confused with the views function) makes the following details about a logged in user available as context variables accross the whole MoReDaT example site:
	<ul>
		<li>the UserDetails object</li>
		<li>the user's assigned tasks</li>
		<li>a bool about the user's consent status</li>
		<li>the number of a user's assigned tasks</li>
		<li>the number of tasks the user has completed</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<h3>task_checker.py</h3>

<p>The Task Checker checks incomplete Tasks (<span class="code">main/models.py</span>) assigned to the current user, and if a task has been completed since the last time the Task Checker has been called, the bool for that task is updated. The task checker is called each time the user loads his/her profile page.</p>



<h2>Customizations</h2>


<h3>User Details: Already done that</h3>

<p>If a user navigates to the get-UD url, s/he will see a warning message that the user details have already been provided. Entering new info will do nothing to the database. As a researcher, you probably want to change this behavior, e.g. to redirect the user to his/her profile. This can be changed on lines 48 and 49 of <span class="code">users/views.py</span>.</p>


<h3>User Details: Gender</h3>

<p>Add/edit/remove gendner options in <span class="code">users/models.py</span> just above the UserDetails class definition.</p>


<h3>User Details: assigning research group</h3>

<p>By default, MoReDaT allows users to chose their own research group. They can be assgned to a default group, e.g. if there's only one target group by setting the default or initial value in the UserDetails model and removing the field from UserDetailsForm. Other solutions are possible but would require more complex customizations beyond the scope of this documetnation.</p>


<h3>User Details: Assigning tasks</h3>

<p>Default task sets are assigned by the <span class="code">get_user_details()</span> function of <span class="code">users/views.py</span>. This behavior can be changed there.</p>
