<h2>Word List Translation App</h2>

		<p>With this app create lists of written stimuli to be translated by participants.</p>

	<h3>Rationale</h3>

		<p>When we know almost nothing about a language, it can be useful to start by translating lists of basic vocabulary and sets of short phrases (grammar paradigms). This app allows for the creation of word (or phrase) list-based Tasks.</p>

	<h3>How it works</h3>
		
		<p>Written stimuli are compiled into lists, and lists form the basis for tasks that can be assigned to research participants. In a task, a participant is presented with items in a list, one at a time, and they provide a response &mdash; either a recorded response (audio and optionally a written version and/or commentary), or an "I don&#39;t know" or "I don&#39;t remember". Responses are recorded as database entries and audio is saved to the media/recorded-audio directory.</p>
