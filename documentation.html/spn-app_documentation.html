<h2>SPN App</h2>

		<p>This app displays predefined sets of image stimuli, one image at a time, and records responses to each image stimulus.</p>

	<h3>Rationale</h3>

		<p>List translation as a means to get acquainted with a new language is useful, but translation tasks have their drawbacks. An alternative to translation tasks are using non verbal stimuli such as photographs and drawings to elicit words and / or short phrases.</p>

	<h3>How it works</h3>

		<p>Participants are assigned one or more SPN tasks, whereby they are charged with providing lexical responses for a predefined set of pictures. For each image in the set, the image is displayed on the screen and the participant provides a response, either they record an audio response (optionally providing a written version of what they say and / or a written commentary) or they select "I don&#39;t know" or "I don&#39;t remember". Responses are saved as database object instances and recorded audio is saved in the server media/recorded-audio directory. Participants proceed through the each task at their own pace.</p>
