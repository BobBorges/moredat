<h2>VIDNAR App</h2>

    <p>This app is for the creation and display of video-based elicitation tasks.</p>

    
	<h3>Rationale</h3>

        <p>Translation of longer stretches of text is generally not an acceptable method in language documentation due to translation effects. Instead it is preferable in most instances to elicit longer stretches of text with non-verbal stimuli such as video and images. This app allows for the creation of video-based elicitation tasks.</p>

    

    
	<h3>How it works</h3>

        <p>In the VIDNAR app, sets of video stimuli are defined and assigned as tasks to research participants. Participants are shown video stimuli in sequence and they should narrate the events of each video stimulus as it plays. Their voice is recordedand audio responses are saved in the media/recorded-audio directory.</p>



    
    <h3>Components</h3>

	    <h4>Models</h4>

            <ul>

                <li><span class="code">VidnarVideo()</span></li>   

                    <p></p>


                <li><span class="code">VidnarVideoSet()</span></li>   

                    <p></p>

            </ul>   
    


    
	    <h4>Views and Templates</h4>

            <ul>

                <li><span class="code">vidnar_home()</span></li>   

                    <p></p>

    
                <li><span class="code">vidnar_welcome()</span></li>   

                    <p></p>


                <li><span class="code">vidnar_trial()</span></li>   

                    <p></p>


                <li><span class="code">vidnar_finish()</span></li>   

                    <p></p>


                <li><span class="code">save_trial_data()</span></li>   

                    <p></p>

            </ul>   
    


    
    	<h4>Forms</h4>

            <ul>

                <li><span class="code">VidnarFinishForm()</span></li>

                    <p>The form has a single boolean field and is rendered with hidden widget in the <span class="code">vidnar-finish.html</span> template by the <span class="code">vidnar_finish()</span> View function.</p>
    
            </ul>   
    


    
        <h4>URLs</h4>

            <p>URL names are transparently linked to the View functions by naming conventions. There are two URL variables <span class="code">vid_set</span> and <span class="code">vidnr</span> which are responsible for rendering model data relating to video sets and videos, respectively</p> 




        <h4>Static files</h4>

            <p>The <span class="code">vidnar</span> app contains functional static files. These are:

                <ul>

                    <li><span class="code">static/vidnar/vidnar-trial.js</span></li>

                        <p></p>


                    <li><span class="code">static/vidnar/vidnar-welcome.js</span></li>

                        <p></p>


                    <li><span class="code">static/vidnar/cues/</span></li>

                        <p></p>


                    <li><span class="code">static/vidnar/vid/</span></li>

                        <p></p>

                </ul>

            There's also a bonus shell script  (requres a Unix system or WSL and ffmpeg to be installed on the $PATH environment) to convert videos in the <span class="code">static/vidnar/vid/</span> to mp4 format.</p>  
    



        <h4>Management commands</h4>

            <ul>

                <li><span class="code">import-vid-set</span></li>

                    <p>Allows to the researcher to import a video set from an <span class="code">.ods</span> spreadsheet instead of creating these one object instance at a time in the admin panel. The <span class="code">vidnar/img-set-ODS/</span> directory provides examples of how the speadsheet should be structured before using this command.</p>

                    <p>Set the video set slanguage to "other_language" / L2 with the <span class="code">-o</span> flag.</p>

            </ul>
