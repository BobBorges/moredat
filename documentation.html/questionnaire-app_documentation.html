<h2>The Questionnaires App</h2>

	<h3>Rationale</h3>

		<p>A frequent activity in linguistics research is the distribution of sociolinguistic survey questionnaires. This app allows the researcher to create multiple questionnaires and distrubute them the users. The questionnaire app is written generically so virtually any type of questionnaire can be designed and deployed with the Questionnaires App. MoReDaT comes with two preconstructed questionnaires &mdash;one about pizza preferences and a shortened version of the EuLaViBar linguistic vitality questionnaire&mdash; to illustrate how the different model components work together.</p>

	<h3>How it works</h3>


		<p>All elements of a questionnaire are model objects and these are constructed via the admin panel. Questionnaire objects contain Question objects. Question objects contain a type specification, and in the case when the question type specifies that there are predefined choises, the Question object contains a Choice-set object. Choice-set objects contain Choice objects. User answers are stored as Answer onjects with three foreign keys: User, Question, and Questionnaire.</p>

		<p>Practically speaking, questionnaires must be constructed from the smallest elememts. That is, if an envisioned question type calls for predefined choices, in the admin panel, Choice objects must be created first. Then a Choice-set can be created and Choices added to it. Once the Choice-set object is created, the Question object can be created and the Choice-set added. Once Question objects are created the Questionnaire object can be created and Question objects added to it. At any stage, more objects can be added to a parent object. In the case when Question object types require a free text answer, the above process can be started from the question object.</p>

		<p>The following types of questions are predefined in the MoReDaT Questionnaires App:
			<ul>
				<li>Short -one line- free text answer</li>
				<li>Options are presented, user selects one</li>
				<li>Options are presented, user selects multiple</li>
				<li>Select predefined options or \'other\' with text input</li>
				<li>Select predefined options and / or \'other\' with text input</li>
				<li>Long(ger) -multi line- free text answer</li>
				<li>Mutliple checkbox-select subquestions in a grid</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

	<h3>Views</h3>

		<p>The <span class="code">views.py</span> file contains views functions and several support functions.</p>

		<h4>home_view</h4>

			<p>This view lists all the available quesitionnaires. It should probably not be accessible to ordinary users.</p>


		<h4>welcome_view</h4>

			<p>This view displays the instructions for each questionnaire to the user. If the current user is the admin user, a list of questions is also displayed.</p>

		<h4>question_view</h4>

			<p></p>

		<h4>finish_view</h4>

			<p></p>


		<h4>Support Functions</h4>

			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>CompileQuestion()</li>
					<li>MakeQuestionForm()</li>
					<li>get_next_slug()</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

		<h3>Forms</h3>

			<h4>QuestionForm</h4>

				<p>Stupid Name for the form that save question answers as instances of the Answer model.</p>

			<h4>OtherFieldForm</h4>

				<p>Form to take text input for questions with choices where one choce is other. This form also saves instances of the Answer model.</p>
