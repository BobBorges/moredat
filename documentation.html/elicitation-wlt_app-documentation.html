<h2>Word List Translation</h2>

    <p>With this app create lists of written stimuli to be translated by participants.</p>



    
    <h3>Rationale</h3>

        <p>When we know almost nothing about a language, it can be useful to start by translating lists of basic vocabulary and sets of short phrases (grammar paradigms). This app allows for the creation of word (or phrase) list-based Tasks.</p>



    
	<h3>How it works</h3>
		
        <p>Written stimuli are compiled into lists, and lists form the basis for tasks that can be assigned to research participants. In a task, a participant is presented with items in a list, one at a time, and they provide a response &mdash; either a recorded response (audio and optionally a written version and/or commentary), or an "I don&#39;t know" or "I don&#39;t remember". Responses are recorded as database entries and audio is saved to the media/recorded-audio directory.</p>



    
    <h3>Components</h3>

	    <h4>Models</h4>

            <ul>

                <li><span class="code">WordlistWord()</span></li>   

                    <p>This model has two fields, "word" and "sort_order". Instances of <span class="code">WordlistWord</span> are the units compiled into a <span class="code">WordlistWordSet</span>.</p>    


                <li><span class="code">WordlistWordSet()</span></li>   

                    <p>This model comprises sets of words and form the basis for <span class="code">wordlisttranslation</span> based tasks. The fields are "name", "slug", words (linked to <span class="code">WordlistWord</span>  objects), "description", "source", and "special_instructions"</p>

                    <p>Words and Word lists can be created manually in the admin panel or the researcher can use the <span class="code">manage.py import-wordlist</span>    command to import a set of words from an ODS speadcheet.</p>    


                <li><span class="code">WordlistResponse()</span></li>   

                    <p>Responses to words are recorded as instances of this model. The fields are "task", "word", "user", "response_type", "audio_response", "written_response" and "commentary". Research participants select from the response types defined in <span class="code">WL_RESONSE_TYPE</span> and the rest of the appropriate info is recorded and saved in the <span class="code">wlt_trial()</span> View function.</p>

            </ul>   
    


    
	    <h4>Views and Templates</h4>

            <ul>

                <li><span class="code">wlt_home()</span></li>   

                    <p>This View renders a list of all the defined wordlisttranslation based tasks. It probably shouldn't be accessible by non-admin users.</p>

    
                <li><span class="code">wlt_welcome()</span></li>   

                    <p>This View displays a general welcome, general instructions and specific instructions for a wordlisttranslation task. There is a link to the testuseraudio app â€“ clicking the link activates the button to start a task. Activation of the button is handled by <span class="code">static/wordlisttranslation/wlt-welcome.js</span>.</p>


                <li><span class="code">wlt_trial()</span></li>   

                    <p>This function renders the current Word object, the url of next word object in a secquence or the <span class="code">wlt_finish()</span>  function url, and the <span class="code">WorrdlistResponseForm</span>   in the <span class="code">wlt-trial.html</span> template. The function also handles POST data (submission of the form + form data). Display of appropriate form fields and handling of audio recording is done with <span class="code">static/wordlisttranslation/wlt-trial.js</span>.</p>


                <li><span class="code">wlt_finish()</span></li>   

                    <p>This view renders the <span class="code">WordlistFinishForm</span> as a hidden widget in the <span class="code">wlt-finish.html</span>as the last page of a task. Submission of the form (clicking the "next" button) marks the current task as complete.</p>

            </ul>   



    
	    <h4>Forms</h4>

            <ul>

                <li><span class="code">WordlistResponseForm()</span></li>   

                    <p>The form is a Model form, responsible for fields in the <span class="code">WordlistResponse</span>   model.</p>

    
                <li><span class="code">WordlistFinishForm()</span></li>   

                    <p>This form is a single boolean field.</p>

            </ul>   



    
        <h4>URLs</h4>   

            <p>URL names are transparently linked to the view functions by naming conventions. The paths themselves consist of a <span class="code">word_set</span> variable and <span class="code">wordnr</span> variable.</p> 



    
        <h4>Static files</h4>

            <p>This app makes use of functional static files
                <ul>

                    <li><span class="code">static/wordlisttranslation/wlt-welcome.js</span></li>
    
                        <p>This JS handles the activation of the button on the <span class="code">wlt-welcome.html</span> template only after the user has navigated to the testuseraudio app. Without this action the user is prevented from starting a task with the button.</p>


                    <li><span class="code">static/wordlisttranslation/wlt-trial.js</span></li>
    
                        <p>Tjos bit of JS handles rendering appropriate form elements given the response type and recording and playback of user audio during a wordlisttranslation task trial.</p>


                </ul>
            </p>    



    
        <h4>Management</h4> 

            <ul>

                <li>the <span class="code">import-wordlist</span> command</li>   

                    <p>Create an ODS spreadsheet containing rows of words for your wordlist and this command will create the necessary model instances automatically. Follow the template in any of the ODS files in <span class="code">wordlisttranslation/wordlist-set-ODS/</span> to structure your sheet appropriately.</p>

            </ul>
