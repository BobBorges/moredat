<h2>VIDNAR App</h2>

		<p>This app is for the creation and display of video-based elicitation tasks.</p>

	<h3>Rationale</h3>

		<p>Translation of longer stretches of text is generally not an acceptable method in language documentation due to translation effects. Instead it is preferable in most instances to elicit longer stretches of text with non-verbal stimuli such as video and images. This app allows for the creation of video-based elicitation tasks.</p>

	<h3>How it works</h3>

		<p>In the VIDNAR app, sets of video stimuli are defined and assigned as tasks to research participants. Participants are shown video stimuli in sequence and they should narrate the events of each video stimulus as it plays. Their voice is recordedand audio responses are saved in the media/recorded-audio directory.</p>
