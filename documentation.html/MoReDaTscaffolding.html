    <p>In order to make MOREDAT Apps operable and testable "out of the box", it is built around the most basic parts of a Django website. This is referred to in the documentation as Scaffolding.</p>



    
    <h3>What is MOREDAT Scaffolding?</h3>

        <p>Scaffolding consists of:
            <ul>
                <li>two apps, <span class="code">main</span> and <span class="code">users</span></li></br>

                    <p>The <span class="code">main</span> app is the root of MOREDAT; it contains the necessary infrastructural components to support a fully functional Django project.</p>
    
                    <p>It is described here in full: ScaffoldingApp/MainApp</p>

    
                    <p>The <span class="code">users</span> app is...</p>    

                    <p>It is described here in full: ScaffoldingApp/UsersApp</p>

    
                <li><span class="code">static</span> and <span class="code">media</span> directories and files</li>

                <li>a development database <span class="code">database.sqlite3</span>

                <li>the <span class="code">manage.py</span> file</li>

            </ul>
        </p>
