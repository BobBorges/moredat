<h1>Using MoReDaT as the basis for a new website</h1>


<p>Here are some things to consider doing if you want to adopt MoReDaT as the basis for a new website:
	<ul>
		<li>Customize urls, viwes functions, and templates in <span class="code">main</span></li>
		<li>Customize the look and feel of the site with css in <span class="code">static/main/main.css</span></li>
		<li>Bulk up your authentication system
			<ul>
				<li>add email field to user registration form</li>
				<li>on create user set <span class="code">is_active</span> to <span class="code">False</span></li>
				<li>confirm email to activate</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>password reset form</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Consider how you want to deploy your site into production (this is well beyond the scope of this documentation, but some things for consideration):
	<ul>
		<li>renting server space or acquiring hardware</li>
		<li>which linux distro do you want to install on</li>
		<li>which webserver software (Apache, Nginx, etc)</li>
		<li>acquiring domain name...</li>
		<li>etc...</li>
	</ul>
