<h2>The <span class="code">static</span> directory</h2>

<p>Basically all files that are not Django/Python code or html templates should be kept in the static directory, including css and javascript, favicons, images, and audio/video stimuli for the MoReDaT Apps.</p>

<p>The <span class="code">static</span> directory is mirrored in organization to the MoReDaT root directory. This means that for each MoReDaT app, there is a directory in <span class="code">static</span> that contains all the static for that app.</p>



<h2>The <span class="code">recorded_audio</span> directory</h2>

<p>This is the directory where tasks that record audio data dump files.</p>
